            <h3>What is CSS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
                <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
                <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
                <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
                
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Use CSS?</h2>
<p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout 
and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
<p>HTML was 
created to <strong>describe the content</strong> of a web page, like:</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 
specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large 
websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single  
page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
<p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

<h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2>
<p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
<p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
